                        Before i started work on my portfolio when it comes to coding i looked at some websites from awwwards in order to get some inspirtations with the help of which i started work on my wireframes in order to get a feel of what i wanted the website to look like. Although the final design was made while coding the portfolio the wireframes proved beneficial when it comes to getting a feel of what the website was supposed to look like.

                        The first steps were choosing a color scheme and one which i really like was white black and red, after the color scheme was chosen i worked on my logo which you can see on the left. I wanted it to look something like a planet so that it fits the whole feel of my website being a living world and the deeper you go into the website the deeper you go into my personality, work and specelties. So i started off by making the main shape and used my name as a asteroid ring. The next step was to learn how to use spline since one of the websites which i checked were using a 3d model created in spline which amazed me and i wanted to create something with it aswell but before i got to work with creating the 3d model you saw on my main page i watched a youtube video of the basics of spline the video you can see below.

                          After the implementation of everything on the main page such as font 3d art outcomes and etc. I started gathering some feedback on improvements which could be made and how to fix a few bugs which i had. Firstly lets start with the bugs, the main one being the spline art since there is an effect based on mouse movement this creates the problem of not being able to scroll while in the container of the object. To fix this i tried using pointer event none which turned it into a 2d video of sorts which kinda ruins my whole idea for it so i decided to see what fixes the teachers had and what i got was to change it to three.js but since i never worked with it before i decided to leave it as it is for now. The second problem was fonts, i figured it out after almost everyone of my group pointed it out and even jan did aswell i think that for this problem i have found a good fix.

                              For our first JS task we had to create a programe which counts up every second and changes the background color. The first itteration i had used an array with already preentered colors and what the code did was choose a random color from the array and change the background color. This version you can see in code pen by pressing the button below.

                            For my final version i decided to do some changes and improvements. I started off with generating the colors for both the background and the numbers using a line of code which makes use of the math command to generate a random rgba value. I also added a line of text at the bottom which says what the next number is going to be this was achieved by just adding a new i and adding +1 to it each second. The final version you can see by using the button below.

                        For this project, we were divided into groups consisting of both second and third semester students. Our objective was to design business cards that represented us as creators. I opted for a straightforward approach, incorporating my logo and replacing the logo on the left with a QR code linked to my portfolio website. You can view the complete design below.

                        For this project, we were tasked with selecting a website that we believed had a subpar user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), and then devising improvements for it. I chose Bvwonen because I encountered significant frustration while using it. The main problems I identified were a difficult login procedure with unhelpful preference filters, menus within menus that were confusing to navigate, and the absence of an English language option, which was especially problematic for a website intended for students. Further information on the issues and their proposed solutions can be found in the document provided below.

                        For this project, we were tasked with creating a pokemon game with the use of API. Initially, I planned to guess the generation of the Pokémon, but I had trouble displaying the correct generation because the API only had generation information for Pokémon from the 4th generation onwards, and some Pokémon belong to multiple generations. So, I changed my idea to guessing which Pokémon has higher stats. This was easier because I could choose a random Pokémon, show it, and compare its base stats with another.

                      <p>
                        However, I encountered a bug where the score kept multiplying every time you made a choice, whether it was right or wrong. This caused the Pokémon to reroll every time, up to 6000 times a second, which made the browser crash.

                        To get the hang of using PWAs we were tasked with using them in order to create a desktop/mobile app . This process was devided in a few steps. Creating the app; Customizing the download buttons and uploading screenshots.

                      last Pwa lesson we had was on how to set the app to work even if the user is offline or what to display if the user is offline. How this works is by using the service worker to download the required data from the cloud and load it in a cache with this the user would be able to access the already downloaded data even if they are offline. But something that i need to look out for is updating the service worker. If any changes are made with a new service worker and they arent overwritten the program would still refer to the last service worker.

                      Last part to this whole project was the creation of keys and subscribers. With the use of JS, Node Js and the push notification zip file provided to us in the modules we had to create a notification system that usses keys for users that have agreed to recieving notification. And the whole project can be checked by pressing the button below.

                        When we presented our portfolio, we also had to make a Abstract that helps people understand what they're about to read. The summary you see when you click the button isn't as good as I wanted it to be. Chris and Penny said I should make it shorter and add more pictures, but Kadian wanted more explanations about the different parts of our project. I thought that too much text would make it boring and people might stop reading so i decided to go with the feedback that Chris and Penny gave me. Even though I made some changes after that, I didn't have enough time to make it that much better.

                      <p>To start, For step one I started off by researching how exactly Blender works which both the video linked below and Wit heled out. With the combined efforts of both me and Wit we started woring on the panorama and ended up with what you could see on the left. This step helped me out alot with understanding how to make planes and the importance of cuts in order to create things such as the roof and the terraces.</p>

                      In this step i finished up the terraces and started adding some windows doors and etc. Which although kinda annoying especially with all of the mistakes that happened and the limited go backs that i had, ended up being quite fun to do but as of the time of writing this i am still working on it and after finishing up the the building i will get to work to adding the garages, creating a car park and a small garden behind the buildings.

                        The final part of my work focused on shading, coloring, and lighting. While I didn't get to complete the lighting aspect, I did spend time on coloring and shading. I experimented with various materials to add color to elements like the garage doors, front doors, and windows, aiming to make them glow in the dark once I add the lighting effects. I also worked on adding glass to the railings of the terraces. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't finish detailing the yard as much as I wanted. Despite this, I'm really pleased with how everything turned out. You can check out the final result by clicking the button below.

                      A lot of websites and apps use sneaky tricks to make things hard for us or to get more out of us. For example, it's super easy to sign up for stuff, but almost impossible to delete your account, which is called a "roach motel." They might ask tricky questions to get answers you didn't mean to give or add extra items to your shopping cart without asking. They can also trick you into sharing more personal info than you want to (Privacy Zuckering) and make it hard to compare prices with other sites. Other sneaky moves include hiding extra costs until the last step of checkout, bait-and-switch tactics where you end up with something you didn’t want, and making you feel bad if you try to opt out of something (confirmshaming). There are also ads that look like regular content and forced continuity where they charge you without warning. Some even spam your friends by asking for your email. Even though these tricks aren't always malicious, they're designed to get more engagement from us, and in gaming, they can even promote addiction.

Althoug dark patters are part of persuation which has a tiny bit of manipulation in it aswell, while dark patters benefit mostly from user error, persuasive techniques are rooted in human instincts and emotions.

                      Persuasive tech uses various tricks to influence people. Its goals include getting information, favors, or engagement, changing opinions or habits, and more. There are two main routes: central (using facts) and peripheral (using cues). Techniques include reciprocity (giving something to get something back), commitment (encouraging consistency), social proof (showing others' approval), authority (appearing professional), liking (being friendly), and scarcity (creating urgency). Persuasive design combines motivation and ability, adjusting barriers and providing specific info and real-time feedback. Motivation is built through rewards, punishments, nagging, emotional connections, pride, and social interaction.

                        During last weeks blender lecture with Chris we started digging a bit deeper into the functions that blender has and how to use them.

                      To begin i started off by trying to follow how Chris did his cube which he chose the cube from the game series portal. To begin with we started getting the cube into the shape we wwnted. Using UAVS booliensand texture renders. But as you could see from the picture on the left i ran into problems with shaping thee cube and using booliens. And with the lecture over i decided to give it a second try later on.

                      For my second attempt i chose to go with the ammo box from one of my favourite games when i was a child, that being Ratchet and Clank. The reason why i went with it is since it was a bit simppler compared to the portal cube but also has alot of complex looing geometry that makes use of renders on flat surfices.

                        For the second itteration i had some more succes and i figured how to use booliens indenting in order to create smootheness around the edges and the cube itself and i also got feedback on how to make the cube more simplistic since the one i had made use of way too many loopcuts and i had alot of wasted geometry.To fix this he suggested keeping it as simple as possible by jsut making the rough shape and using renders to create more complex geometry.

                    This is the second part to our process that helps keep our client up to date with our process. In it we have gone a bit more into detailes when it comes to what our concept is. For example this contains POVs which give insight into the target group we chose, their needs their background and their frustrations. Another huge part of this document are the How might we questions which go into details of how we can improve the user experience by answering to some questions that might arise during the use of our product, such as, How might we create immersive and interactive experiences; How might we leverage digital platforms and social media channels to create virtual experiences that allow individuals like Fleur and Jan to interact with historical artifacts, documents, and multimedia content related to World War II in Eindhoven and etc. The document also contains an empathy map which i still think was quite early to develop since we need atleast a working prototype in order to find out how exactly the users would interact with it. This map you can see on the left.

                        Before getting to coding me and QA got to work with the creation of the paper prototype of our websites. 1 for our group project and 1 for our brand which we would continue with our passion project. To begin we wanted to create a simple website that would host the video. For start we decided of having 2 sections 1 for video and 1 for the company that would in turn lead to their website. A few questions arose with the way we would display the video while QA suggested we have the first section just for the video i suggested we create a banner with a brief moto for the video and when pressed it would in turn switch to the video.

                      After we finished the paper prototype i tested it with a friend of mine in order to get a perspective from a member of our chosen target audience of students and young adults between the ages of 16 to 30, even though i usualy hate testing papper prototypes due to them being quite limited to the amount of interactivity they could have. But after giving it to my friend he suggested a few improvements such as changing the footer so that it doesnt look as empty. center the items in the header and to add some motion when we reach the site implementation phase to make it look less bland.

                        With the figma prototype we wanted to stick as close to the paper prototype as possible while also implementing the improvements that my friend suggested. With this the improvements we made were we centered everything on the header added the color scheme from the 18th september and added a background to the main section and decided to add 3 answers from people that work at 18th september about what the company means to them in order to fill in some of the empty space on our website and to give it a bit of a personal touch to the website. We also created a prototype for our own brand website but we still havent done any research on it since we would be working on it for the passion project. Both prototypes you can see by pressing the button below.

                        At last we completed the website. with the main improvemnts that we made being we added a tint over the first section and started with a static image which after some feedback we swapped out for a trailer video in order to make the website feel alive and to ensure we grab the users attention. The second improvement which i made was adding the background image with a blue tint at the second section.

                      As i previously mentioned we recieved feedback on our design from both Kadian and Jan. What kadian suggested is to work abit on the header to make it abit better and me and qa had 2 ideas one was to remove the hamburger menu and change it for buttons in order to fill in the empty space in the header. I had the idea to use Texture similarly to what i did in my portfolio. QA and I tried improving it but it will take me some time to make the textures in order to use in the header.The second part of the feedback from kadian was to change the background of the first section which was something that we were planning on doing even before the feedback, the main reason being that we knew it was way too static but our first idea was to just add animation to the image of zooming in and out, but during the feedback the idea of using a teaser video as a background arose. We also got some good feedback and that being that Kadian really liked the second section and what I have done with it. From jan we got the feedback to work on the second section and turn it into more of a movie poster instead of the original idea of having the quotes from the company representatives.

                      We need to focus on effectively using our brand colors. It is crucial to include detailed information about our clients and past projects. We should implement a light/dark mode toggle for user preference. Ensure the website is responsive across multiple devices. Clearly articulate our services to visitors. Develop a user-friendly UI to enhance navigation and usability. Provide multiple contact options for accessibility and convenience.

                        We conducted a survey among media students and people with media production experience to gather important information for creating a studio website. Although this group is not exactly the same as our target audience of small indie companies, their insights are still very useful. These respondents have experience that can help guide our development process effectively. Here are the key findings from our survey:

                      Device Usage: Most people use both desktops/laptops and smartphones, so our website needs to be responsive and work well on all devices. Key Information: It is essential to include information about the services offered and past projects on the website. Design Preference: Most respondents prefer a modern and minimalistic look for the website, so we should focus on that style. Expected Features: The website should have high-quality visuals and videos, an interactive portfolio, easy navigation, and social media integration. Things to Avoid: We need to avoid slow loading times, poor design or layout, difficult navigation, and a lack of information. Importance of Design: The design of the website is crucial in helping people decide whether to choose a studio. Newsletter: Creating a newsletter is not necessary.

                        We carefully prepared an interview for our target group, which consists of small indie companies. After receiving feedback from our teachers, the questions were finalized. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, we were unable to conduct interviews with our target audience. As an alternative, we decided to get answers from AI to see if they would be helpful. After discussing this approach with our teachers and getting their approval, we went ahead. To make it more realistic, we asked the AI to pretend to be a representative from a small indie studio. The results were very satisfying, and we got a lot of interesting answers.

                      By interviewing the AI, we gathered valuable insights for creating our studio website. We learned that a clean layout, easy navigation, and high-quality visuals are crucial. Important features include clear service descriptions, client testimonials, and case studies. The website should be fast-loading, mobile-friendly, and have interactive elements that enhance the user experience. Additionally, case studies and detailed service presentations are significant for showing our quality and style. Finally, appreciated websites like Vimeo and Wistia provide good examples of design and content. This information will help us build a website that effectively meets the needs of small indie companies.

These insights were organized into four main categories: Think & Feel, See, Hear, Say & Do.

                        For our passion project, we wanted to create a website for our studio. We had an initial design, but after analyzing our competitors, we made some changes to improve it. Here’s what we did:

                      For our project ever since starting we knew we wanted to create a studio website that would focus on small indie developers with website and video creation.

                        We noticed that our original design, which had a white background, was too bright for some people. To make our website more accessible and user-friendly, we added a dark mode toggle. This way, users can switch to a darker background if they find it more comfortable. We expect this change to increase user engagement and satisfaction by reducing eye strain.

                      Our competitor analysis showed that other studio websites clearly state the services they offer. To improve our site, we redesigned the "About Us" section to make it more readable and updated the "Projects" section to better explain our services. We believe these changes will help users navigate our site more easily and understand what we offer, leading to better customer satisfaction.

                        We found that competitor websites are easily viewable on different devices, from desktops to smartphones. To match this standard, we adjusted our code to make our site mobile responsive. This means our website now looks good and works well on any device. We expect this change to increase our site’s compatibility and show users that we pay attention to detail.

I was responsible for the navigation bar and the main section that contained the information of our studio , who we are and what we do. The biggest problems i faced was with the integration of the light and dark theme. These proved to be quite difficult not becouse of the code but because the problems we faced was with the js not reading the propper links to the images after hosting the website to hera.

                      <p>The feedback from our playtests provided valuable insights. While users appreciated features like the dark mode and the lively visuals, there were concerns about the emptiness of the projects section and the usefulness of the contact form. Moving forward, we should consider filling out the projects section with more details and revising or replacing the contact form to better meet user expectations. This feedback will help us improve the overall user experience and make the website more appealing and professional. But even though we did some changes due to the time concerns we couldnt finish everything.</p>
