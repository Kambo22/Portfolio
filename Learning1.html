                        Before i started work on my portfolio when it comes to coding i looked at some websites from awwwards in order to get some inspirtations with the help of which i started work on my wireframes in order to get a feel of what i wanted the website to look like. Although the final design was made while coding the portfolio the wireframes proved beneficial when it comes to getting a feel of what the website was supposed to look like.

                        The first steps were choosing a color scheme and one which i really like was white black and red, after the color scheme was chosen i worked on my logo which you can see on the left. I wanted it to look something like a planet so that it fits the whole feel of my website being a living world and the deeper you go into the website the deeper you go into my personality, work and specelties. So i started off by making the main shape and used my name as a asteroid ring. The next step was to learn how to use spline since one of the websites which i checked were using a 3d model created in spline which amazed me and i wanted to create something with it aswell but before i got to work with creating the 3d model you saw on my main page i watched a youtube video of the basics of spline the video you can see below.

                          After the implementation of everything on the main page such as font 3d art outcomes and etc. I started gathering some feedback on improvements which could be made and how to fix a few bugs which i had. Firstly lets start with the bugs, the main one being the spline art since there is an effect based on mouse movement this creates the problem of not being able to scroll while in the container of the object. To fix this i tried using pointer event none which turned it into a 2d video of sorts which kinda ruins my whole idea for it so i decided to see what fixes the teachers had and what i got was to change it to three.js but since i never worked with it before i decided to leave it as it is for now. The second problem was fonts, i figured it out after almost everyone of my group pointed it out and even jan did aswell i think that for this problem i have found a good fix.

                        <p>In conclusion i am very proud of what i was able to achieve in the short time span due to the uncommunicated deadline and although i still wasnt able to create the outcome page which i wanted i think this portfolio will be well appriciated.</p>

                              For our first JS task we had to create a programe which counts up every second and changes the background color. The first itteration i had used an array with already preentered colors and what the code did was choose a random color from the array and change the background color. This version you can see in code pen by pressing the button below.

                            For my final version i decided to do some changes and improvements. I started off with generating the colors for both the background and the numbers using a line of code which makes use of the math command to generate a random rgba value. I also added a line of text at the bottom which says what the next number is going to be this was achieved by just adding a new i and adding +1 to it each second. The final version you can see by using the button below.

                        For this project, we were divided into groups consisting of both second and third semester students. Our objective was to design business cards that represented us as creators. I opted for a straightforward approach, incorporating my logo and replacing the logo on the left with a QR code linked to my portfolio website. You can view the complete design below.

                        For this project, we were tasked with selecting a website that we believed had a subpar user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), and then devising improvements for it. I chose Bvwonen because I encountered significant frustration while using it. The main problems I identified were a difficult login procedure with unhelpful preference filters, menus within menus that were confusing to navigate, and the absence of an English language option, which was especially problematic for a website intended for students. Further information on the issues and their proposed solutions can be found in the document provided below.
