                        Before i started work on my portfolio when it comes to coding i looked at some websites from awwwards in order to get some inspirtations with the help of which i started work on my wireframes in order to get a feel of what i wanted the website to look like. Although the final design was made while coding the portfolio the wireframes proved beneficial when it comes to getting a feel of what the website was supposed to look like.

                        The first steps were choosing a color scheme and one which i really like was white black and red, after the color scheme was chosen i worked on my logo which you can see on the left. I wanted it to look something like a planet so that it fits the whole feel of my website being a living world and the deeper you go into the website the deeper you go into my personality, work and specelties. So i started off by making the main shape and used my name as a asteroid ring. The next step was to learn how to use spline since one of the websites which i checked were using a 3d model created in spline which amazed me and i wanted to create something with it aswell but before i got to work with creating the 3d model you saw on my main page i watched a youtube video of the basics of spline the video you can see below.

                          After the implementation of everything on the main page such as font 3d art outcomes and etc. I started gathering some feedback on improvements which could be made and how to fix a few bugs which i had. Firstly lets start with the bugs, the main one being the spline art since there is an effect based on mouse movement this creates the problem of not being able to scroll while in the container of the object. To fix this i tried using pointer event none which turned it into a 2d video of sorts which kinda ruins my whole idea for it so i decided to see what fixes the teachers had and what i got was to change it to three.js but since i never worked with it before i decided to leave it as it is for now. The second problem was fonts, i figured it out after almost everyone of my group pointed it out and even jan did aswell i think that for this problem i have found a good fix.

                              For our first JS task we had to create a programe which counts up every second and changes the background color. The first itteration i had used an array with already preentered colors and what the code did was choose a random color from the array and change the background color. This version you can see in code pen by pressing the button below.

                            For my final version i decided to do some changes and improvements. I started off with generating the colors for both the background and the numbers using a line of code which makes use of the math command to generate a random rgba value. I also added a line of text at the bottom which says what the next number is going to be this was achieved by just adding a new i and adding +1 to it each second. The final version you can see by using the button below.

                        For this project, we were divided into groups consisting of both second and third semester students. Our objective was to design business cards that represented us as creators. I opted for a straightforward approach, incorporating my logo and replacing the logo on the left with a QR code linked to my portfolio website. You can view the complete design below.

                        For this project, we were tasked with selecting a website that we believed had a subpar user experience (UX) and user interface (UI), and then devising improvements for it. I chose Bvwonen because I encountered significant frustration while using it. The main problems I identified were a difficult login procedure with unhelpful preference filters, menus within menus that were confusing to navigate, and the absence of an English language option, which was especially problematic for a website intended for students. Further information on the issues and their proposed solutions can be found in the document provided below.

                        For this project, we were tasked with creating a pokemon game with the use of API. Initially, I planned to guess the generation of the Pokémon, but I had trouble displaying the correct generation because the API only had generation information for Pokémon from the 4th generation onwards, and some Pokémon belong to multiple generations. So, I changed my idea to guessing which Pokémon has higher stats. This was easier because I could choose a random Pokémon, show it, and compare its base stats with another.

                      <p>
                        However, I encountered a bug where the score kept multiplying every time you made a choice, whether it was right or wrong. This caused the Pokémon to reroll every time, up to 6000 times a second, which made the browser crash.

                        To get the hang of using PWAs we were tasked with using them in order to create a desktop/mobile app . This process was devided in a few steps. Creating the app; Customizing the download buttons and uploading screenshots.

                      last Pwa lesson we had was on how to set the app to work even if the user is offline or what to display if the user is offline. How this works is by using the service worker to download the required data from the cloud and load it in a cache with this the user would be able to access the already downloaded data even if they are offline. But something that i need to look out for is updating the service worker. If any changes are made with a new service worker and they arent overwritten the program would still refer to the last service worker.

                      Last part to this whole project was the creation of keys and subscribers. With the use of JS, Node Js and the push notification zip file provided to us in the modules we had to create a notification system that usses keys for users that have agreed to recieving notification. And the whole project can be checked by pressing the button below.

                        When we presented our portfolio, we also had to make a Abstract that helps people understand what they're about to read. The summary you see when you click the button isn't as good as I wanted it to be. Chris and Penny said I should make it shorter and add more pictures, but Kadian wanted more explanations about the different parts of our project. I thought that too much text would make it boring and people might stop reading so i decided to go with the feedback that Chris and Penny gave me. Even though I made some changes after that, I didn't have enough time to make it that much better.

                      <p>To start, For step one I started off by researching how exactly Blender works which both the video linked below and Wit heled out. With the combined efforts of both me and Wit we started woring on the panorama and ended up with what you could see on the left. This step helped me out alot with understanding how to make planes and the importance of cuts in order to create things such as the roof and the terraces.</p>

                      In this step i finished up the terraces and started adding some windows doors and etc. Which although kinda annoying especially with all of the mistakes that happened and the limited go backs that i had, ended up being quite fun to do but as of the time of writing this i am still working on it and after finishing up the the building i will get to work to adding the garages, creating a car park and a small garden behind the buildings.

                        The final part of my work focused on shading, coloring, and lighting. While I didn't get to complete the lighting aspect, I did spend time on coloring and shading. I experimented with various materials to add color to elements like the garage doors, front doors, and windows, aiming to make them glow in the dark once I add the lighting effects. I also worked on adding glass to the railings of the terraces. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't finish detailing the yard as much as I wanted. Despite this, I'm really pleased with how everything turned out. You can check out the final result by clicking the button below.
