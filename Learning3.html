                      Before i started work on my portfolio when it comes to coding i looked at some websites from awwwards in order to get some inspirtations with the help of which i started work on my wireframes in order to get a feel of what i wanted the website to look like. Although the final design was made while coding the portfolio the wireframes proved beneficial when it comes to getting a feel of what the website was supposed to look like.

                      The first steps were choosing a color scheme and one which i really like was white black and red, after the color scheme was chosen i worked on my logo which you can see on the left. I wanted it to look something like a planet so that it fits the whole feel of my website being a living world and the deeper you go into the website the deeper you go into my personality, work and specelties. So i started off by making the main shape and used my name as a asteroid ring. The next step was to learn how to use spline since one of the websites which i checked were using a 3d model created in spline which amazed me and i wanted to create something with it aswell but before i got to work with creating the 3d model you saw on my main page i watched a youtube video of the basics of spline the video you can see below.

                        After the implementation of everything on the main page such as font 3d art outcomes and etc. I started gathering some feedback on improvements which could be made and how to fix a few bugs which i had. Firstly lets start with the bugs, the main one being the spline art since there is an effect based on mouse movement this creates the problem of not being able to scroll while in the container of the object. To fix this i tried using pointer event none which turned it into a 2d video of sorts which kinda ruins my whole idea for it so i decided to see what fixes the teachers had and what i got was to change it to three.js but since i never worked with it before i decided to leave it as it is for now. The second problem was fonts, i figured it out after almost everyone of my group pointed it out and even jan did aswell i think that for this problem i have found a good fix.

                      <p>In conclusion i am very proud of what i was able to achieve in the short time span due to the uncommunicated deadline and although i still wasnt able to create the outcome page which i wanted i think this portfolio will be well appriciated.</p>

                              After deciding on our values and color scheme as a group we started work on logos during which we faced some problems that were pointed to us but our teachers such as our first logo having text which made it unreadable when it was smaller and us not really going out in more directions. The logo in question you can see on the left. After the feedback we decided to start drawing some logos (i am sorry but i dont have a photo of the sketches) and then we transfered them into figma and started creating them after we did we chose two of them as the best ones and after a second vote we chose out final logo which you can see in the second picture on the left. and by pressing the button below you will be able to see all of our logos.

                            We finalized the logo displayed on the left, which emerged from the sketches we developed after Chris recommended taking a step back and focusing on prototypes before diving into designing it in tools like Figma or other design applications. To determine the color scheme, we incorporated a gradient between our brand colors. To preview how it would appear against various background colors, we inserted it into our JavaScript code for the counting task and allowed it to generate random background colors. Once completed, we incorporated it into our brand book. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a direct link to the brand book at the moment due to issues with my InDesign version. I am currently awaiting the PDF from Minh. When I receive it, I will promptly provide the link via the button below.
