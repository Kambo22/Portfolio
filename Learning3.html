                      Before i started work on my portfolio when it comes to coding i looked at some websites from awwwards in order to get some inspirtations with the help of which i started work on my wireframes in order to get a feel of what i wanted the website to look like. Although the final design was made while coding the portfolio the wireframes proved beneficial when it comes to getting a feel of what the website was supposed to look like.

                      The first steps were choosing a color scheme and one which i really like was white black and red, after the color scheme was chosen i worked on my logo which you can see on the left. I wanted it to look something like a planet so that it fits the whole feel of my website being a living world and the deeper you go into the website the deeper you go into my personality, work and specelties. So i started off by making the main shape and used my name as a asteroid ring. The next step was to learn how to use spline since one of the websites which i checked were using a 3d model created in spline which amazed me and i wanted to create something with it aswell but before i got to work with creating the 3d model you saw on my main page i watched a youtube video of the basics of spline the video you can see below.

                        After the implementation of everything on the main page such as font 3d art outcomes and etc. I started gathering some feedback on improvements which could be made and how to fix a few bugs which i had. Firstly lets start with the bugs, the main one being the spline art since there is an effect based on mouse movement this creates the problem of not being able to scroll while in the container of the object. To fix this i tried using pointer event none which turned it into a 2d video of sorts which kinda ruins my whole idea for it so i decided to see what fixes the teachers had and what i got was to change it to three.js but since i never worked with it before i decided to leave it as it is for now. The second problem was fonts, i figured it out after almost everyone of my group pointed it out and even jan did aswell i think that for this problem i have found a good fix.

                              After deciding on our values and color scheme as a group we started work on logos during which we faced some problems that were pointed to us but our teachers such as our first logo having text which made it unreadable when it was smaller and us not really going out in more directions. The logo in question you can see on the left. After the feedback we decided to start drawing some logos (i am sorry but i dont have a photo of the sketches) and then we transfered them into figma and started creating them after we did we chose two of them as the best ones and after a second vote we chose out final logo which you can see in the second picture on the left. and by pressing the button below you will be able to see all of our logos.

                            We finalized the logo displayed on the left, which emerged from the sketches we developed after Chris recommended taking a step back and focusing on prototypes before diving into designing it in tools like Figma or other design applications. To determine the color scheme, we incorporated a gradient between our brand colors. To preview how it would appear against various background colors, we inserted it into our JavaScript code for the counting task and allowed it to generate random background colors. Once completed, we incorporated it into our brand book. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a direct link to the brand book at the moment due to issues with my InDesign version. I am currently awaiting the PDF from Minh. When I receive it, I will promptly provide the link via the button below.

                            As a team, our first move was to decide what we wanted to make and where we wanted to take it. After throwing around ideas, we settled on making an interactive documentary where you get to pick the direction of the story. Our documentary will explore various stories from the war, allowing viewers to choose their own path and see different outcomes based on their choices. After finalizing the idea we started off with making some sketches and eventually creating the wireframes of how we wanted our website to look.

                            Before we started work on the creation of the surveys, interviews and personas we started off by emailing our client in order to get a cleared direction of what was wanted from us, who our target group is and to ask for access to some extra materials in order to find out what our limitations are going to be. The emails you can see below

                            Once we settled on our project idea, we began by designing a survey. This helped us learn more about how our target audience typically engages with this kind of media. Our findings showed that the majority of our audience fell between the ages of 18 and 30, and they prefer learning through visual mediums like films, videos, and documentaries.

                            We also made a mood board to help us and our clients envision our project. It included screenshots from videos and games that share a similar concept to ours, where the story is mainly driven by the user's choices(Bander snatch, Risk of rain, Detroit: Become human and etc).

                            During the creation of the interview we also worked on the competitor analysis document in which we compared the previously mentioned movies video games and shows in order to find out what they did well what could be improved and what the users didnâ€™t like about them  based on reviews and discussions online. All this was done in order to figure out what our products should strive to do and what it should avoid.

                            We also made a competitor analysis on the events that that other popular liberation organisations organise in order to see which event people like most and why. In order to achieve this we once again went over the all of the strength of the events what makes them interesting to people. The biggest factor from what we saw was the oportunity to meet new people and engage in various activities. We also went over weaknesses and how to improve the events and the most common one was lack of identity since the ones we took a look at were party oriented events which lacks a particular theme and identity as i mentioned previously.

                            The next major step was the creation of the Personas after gathering as much survey answers as we could in the given time frame we created a few personas in order to help us visualize the few major target groups such as people that have heard of the events from 18th september, people that havenâ€™t but are interested in history and etc. We used these personas to help us visualize and compact the data so we could figure out exactly what the users want.

                            After collecting data from surveys, interviews, and extra secondary research, we put together this Empathy Map, as a way to help us really get what our target users are all about. This Empathy map is both related to the 18th September event, as well as their thoughts on Interactive storytelling as a whole.

                            Based on the Empathy map above, the significance of the 18th September event has waned over the years, particularly among both younger and older generations. Even though it is a traditional event, both found it not as special as it used to be. However, the rich history associated with this event still resonate across generations.

                      <p>
                        From the first interview we learned that Ruyet prefers learning through visual mediums like movies, videos, and interactive stories rather than traditional methods like books. He enjoys educational content more when he is not aware it's educational beforehand, possibly because it feels less forced. He tends to get bored initially but can later enjoy movies or activities he was initially resistant to. He likes quick, visually engaging summaries and prefer options that interests him without worrying much about the outcome. He appreciates concise explanations and the option for more in-depth information if he chooses. He prefers a combination of narration and subtitles and enjoys interactive elements like GIFs or videos with controls for deeper exploration.
                      </p>

                      <h5 class="subheading">Key takeaways Interview II:</h5>
                      <p>
                        She prefers learning through a variety of mediums like books, classes, and movies, particularly about topics like World War 2. She often seeks out additional information online. Her interest in learning varies depending on the topic, but she appreciates both text and visual resources. She's aware of events like "freedom cycling" and understands the significance of memorial lights on September 18th, likely through word of mouth from colleagues. Regarding interactive stories, she's familiar with the concept but lacks detailed knowledge. She enjoys the freedom to choose directions in stories and finds them more engaging than traditional quizzes or tests, although she can become frustrated with lengthy content. She prefers skipping ahead or having timestamps to navigate. She favors a timeline structure over chapters and prefers interactive elements like skipping shortcuts rather than holding to speed up. She values educational elements in interactive stories and sees potential benefits for her children. She picks story choices based on immersion and enjoys having freedom to explore different options. She suggests ideas like using AR to visualize the past. Overall, she seeks immersive and engaging educational experiences, especially in interactive storytelling formats.

                        After compiling all of our research we wrote a document about our methods, findings and why they are important to us. This document will in turn be sent to our client in order to display our progress thus far with the project. Everything that i have talked previously in this portfolio has been detailed indepth in this research document.

                      This is the second part to our process that helps keep our client up to date with our process. In it we have gone a bit more into detailes when it comes to what our concept is. For example this contains POVs which give insight into the target group we chose, their needs their background and their frustrations. Another huge part of this document are the How might we questions which go into details of how we can improve the user experience by answering to some questions that might arise during the use of our product, such as, How might we create immersive and interactive experiences; How might we leverage digital platforms and social media channels to create virtual experiences that allow individuals like Fleur and Jan to interact with historical artifacts, documents, and multimedia content related to World War II in Eindhoven and etc. The document also contains an empathy map which i still think was quite early to develop since we need atleast a working prototype in order to find out how exactly the users would interact with it. This map you can see on the left.
