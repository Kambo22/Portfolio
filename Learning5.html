                    <p>I have several goals for the next few years, with the primary one being to successfully complete the semester. Given that this has been my most stressful semester yet, I've engaged in reflection and taken significant steps towards improvement. One crucial realization is the importance of feedback to my progress. Consequently, I plan on actively seeking feedback for every change I make until the end of the semester. 
                    My second goal is centered around my future aspirations. Recognizing my interest in focusing on front-end programming, I've decided to explore additional options. To broaden my skill set, I've embarked on an online course to attain a certificate in C#. The rationale behind this decision is rooted in the belief that a professional with proficiency in both back-end and front-end skills would be more desirable than someone solely specializing in the front end.</p>

                      It goes without saying that i am still quite unhappy with how the semester works but after putting the problem infront of jan and petra i understood what i could do in order to ensure a smoother sailing. The main takeaway was that the workshops need to be schedule by us if we need some help so as a group we gathered and discussed what we needed such as some animations lessons, semanthics and etc. And i can say that this last week i have been very happy with the lessons that the teachers began giving us such as PWA and Blender which have prooved very useful to me since now i can swap out the spline 3d orb i have with a blender render and get rid of the annoying water mark also making this portfolio into an actual app would be something quite cool in my opinion.

                     In order to develop and improve our blender skills Chris tasked us with creating a panorama of a building we choose. First i went over what i wanted to create and decided to recreate one of the blocks i have grown up in. This project took a few steps in order to be completed and below i will go over them.

                    <p>To start, For step one I started off by researching how exactly Blender works which both the video linked below and Wit heled out. With the combined efforts of both me and Wit we started woring on the panorama and ended up with what you could see on the left. This step helped me out alot with understanding how to make planes and the importance of cuts in order to create things such as the roof and the terraces.</p>

                    In this step i finished up the terraces and started adding some windows doors and etc. Which although kinda annoying especially with all of the mistakes that happened and the limited go backs that i had, ended up being quite fun to do but as of the time of writing this i am still working on it and after finishing up the the building i will get to work to adding the garages, creating a car park and a small garden behind the buildings.

                      The final part of my work focused on shading, coloring, and lighting. While I didn't get to complete the lighting aspect, I did spend time on coloring and shading. I experimented with various materials to add color to elements like the garage doors, front doors, and windows, aiming to make them glow in the dark once I add the lighting effects. I also worked on adding glass to the railings of the terraces. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I couldn't finish detailing the yard as much as I wanted. Despite this, I'm really pleased with how everything turned out. You can check out the final result by clicking the button below.
