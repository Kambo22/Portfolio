                    <p>I have several goals for the next few years, with the primary one being to successfully complete the semester. Given that this has been my most stressful semester yet, I've engaged in reflection and taken significant steps towards improvement. One crucial realization is the importance of feedback to my progress. Consequently, I plan on actively seeking feedback for every change I make until the end of the semester. 
                    My second goal is centered around my future aspirations. Recognizing my interest in focusing on front-end programming, I've decided to explore additional options. To broaden my skill set, I've embarked on an online course to attain a certificate in C#. The rationale behind this decision is rooted in the belief that a professional with proficiency in both back-end and front-end skills would be more desirable than someone solely specializing in the front end.</p>

                      It goes without saying that i am still quite unhappy with how the semester works but after putting the problem infront of jan and petra i understood what i could do in order to ensure a smoother sailing. The main takeaway was that the workshops need to be schedule by us if we need some help so as a group we gathered and discussed what we needed such as some animations lessons, semanthics and etc. And i can say that this last week i have been very happy with the lessons that the teachers began giving us such as PWA and Blender which have prooved very useful to me since now i can swap out the spline 3d orb i have with a blender render and get rid of the annoying water mark also making this portfolio into an actual app would be something quite cool in my opinion.
