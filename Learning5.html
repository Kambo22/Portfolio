                    <p>I have several goals for the next few years, with the primary one being to successfully complete the semester. Given that this has been my most stressful semester yet, I've engaged in reflection and taken significant steps towards improvement. One crucial realization is the importance of feedback to my progress. Consequently, I plan on actively seeking feedback for every change I make until the end of the semester. 
                    My second goal is centered around my future aspirations. Recognizing my interest in focusing on front-end programming, I've decided to explore additional options. To broaden my skill set, I've embarked on an online course to attain a certificate in C#. The rationale behind this decision is rooted in the belief that a professional with proficiency in both back-end and front-end skills would be more desirable than someone solely specializing in the front end.</p>

                      It goes without saying that i am still quite unhappy with how the semester works but after putting the problem infront of jan and petra i understood what i could do in order to ensure a smoother sailing. The main takeaway was that the workshops need to be schedule by us if we need some help so as a group we gathered and discussed what we needed such as some animations lessons, semanthics and etc. And i can say that this last week i have been very happy with the lessons that the teachers began giving us such as PWA and Blender which have prooved very useful to me since now i can swap out the spline 3d orb i have with a blender render and get rid of the annoying water mark also making this portfolio into an actual app would be something quite cool in my opinion.

                      After my last feedback it was suggested that i start looking into job aplications and what skills they require so in order to fill in these blanks i talked with a few cousins of mine in IT.

                      So the first person i called was my first cousin that works at Econt, a delivery company, as a project manager. He has finished the technical university in Ruse and said that they in particular dont look all that much in particular languages, but at work experience and certificates. He also mentioned that based on those 2 things they will find a sector or possition that best suits me. But he also mentioned that if i have Certificates for Python, Java, c# and JS that will give me a really big advantage over the rest.

                      I also talked with my second cousin that works for an American company, which i am not going to lie i forgot the name of, as a backend developer. I decided to talk to him in particular due to him working from home which was my plan after graduation. For him he said that it really depends on the sector i would like to work in and for front end he mentioned that i would need to be able to work with React, HTML, CSS and something that resembles bootstrap. He also mentioned that they in particular dont need much proof as a recomendation from a worker in the company would be enough to get in and after a 6 month training they will decide whether you get the job or not.

                  <p>In conclusion These talks helped me quite alot as to what the Proffesionalfield in Bulgaria look for in the Proffesionals they decide to hire. With this knowledge i will continue to work on my JS skills as much as possible due to them being on the weaker side compared to html css and even my C#</p>
