                              Our first task as a group was to create a contract for our studio. The final version you can see by pressing the button below. For the creation of it we decided on commitments and consequences for not obiding by them and those being punctionality to stay connected on whatsapp if something pops out such as problems with ns people being late etc. When it comes to to the consequences we discussed some option when me and will propposed a strike system based on if people are missing, being late, missing deadlines and etc but to make it more lineant we decided to vote as a team on whether a strike should be applied or not which I think was a great idea for keeping things from getting out of hand.

                            After deciding on our values and color scheme as a group we started work on logos during which we faced some problems that were pointed to us but our teachers such as our first logo having text which made it unreadable when it was smaller and us not really going out in more directions. The logo in question you can see on the left. After the feedback we decided to start drawing some logos (i am sorry but i dont have a photo of the sketches) and then we transfered them into figma and started creating them after we did we chose two of them as the best ones and after a second vote we chose out final logo which you can see in the second picture on the left. and by pressing the button below you will be able to see all of our logos.

                          We finalized the logo displayed on the left, which emerged from the sketches we developed after Chris recommended taking a step back and focusing on prototypes before diving into designing it in tools like Figma or other design applications. To determine the color scheme, we incorporated a gradient between our brand colors. To preview how it would appear against various background colors, we inserted it into our JavaScript code for the counting task and allowed it to generate random background colors. Once completed, we incorporated it into our brand book. Unfortunately, I am unable to provide a direct link to the brand book at the moment due to issues with my InDesign version. I am currently awaiting the PDF from Minh. When I receive it, I will promptly provide the link via the button below.
