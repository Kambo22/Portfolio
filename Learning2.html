                        in order to prove this i have used comments to explain my code for the counting task, the portfolio and also when you click the button below you will be able to see my other project uploaded in my github. But sadly using git didn't go as smoothly as I wanted, with me experiencing a problem with my portfolio git due to my video size being too big and it messed up all of my commits. In order to fix this i tried a few things such as trying to removing it from repository but since the changes werent commited they weren't in there so the next thing i tried was using the command " git reset –hard HEAD@[n]" to reset my commits but before doing that i made sure i created a zip with my current version of the portfolio.

                          In order to keep the group project in check we decided to use gitlab and after deviding what each person of the development team was supposed to do we created 3 branches, one for each of us, hoping that after we merge it we wouldnt run into many issues we started to work on the website. After making sure we named every file we needed correctly we decided to merge and ended up just with a few minor issues such as fonts, which we fixed a little later on. (Due to my pushes being made from my github for some reason all of the pushes you see made by Kambo22 are the ones made by me)

                          For the passion project we decided to continue work as a studio. Will and I were the ones tasked with the development of the website and after gathering all of the research information and finishing the prototypes we got to work. After we were done with our part we got to merging. And as i expeted we ran into a merge conflict and in order to fix that we first tried with accept changes features of git but after that didnt work we went to our braches and copy pasted the parts of our codes that we needed and went over and fixed repeating code mostly about fonts and so on.
