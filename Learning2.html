                        in order to prove this i have used comments to explain my code for the counting task, the portfolio and also when you click the button below you will be able to see my other project uploaded in my github. But sadly using git didn't go as smoothly as I wanted, with me experiencing a problem with my portfolio git due to my video size being too big and it messed up all of my commits. In order to fix this i tried a few things such as trying to removing it from repository but since the changes werent commited they weren't in there so the next thing i tried was using the command " git reset –hard HEAD@[n]" to reset my commits but before doing that i made sure i created a zip with my current version of the portfolio.

                          In order to keep the group project in check we decided to use gitlab and after deviding what each person of the development team was supposed to do we created 3 branches, one for each of us, hoping that after we merge it we wouldnt run into many issues we started to work on the website. After making sure we named every file we needed correctly we decided to merge and ended up just with a few minor issues such as fonts, which we fixed a little later on.

                          For this project, our assignment was to compile documentation for three passion projects, which could be websites or services based on ideas we are familiar with and passionate about. I chose to create documentation for three projects. The first project is a ticket ordering service specifically designed for basketball games. The second project focuses on dynamic pricing for tickets, primarily targeting event organizers and organizations interested in analyzing sales performance based on various factors such as the importance of the games being played and the teams involved. Lastly, the third idea revolves around a health tracker app aimed at helping individuals monitor their physical activity throughout the day, with a special emphasis on providing personalization features to tailor the app to each user's preferences and needs.
