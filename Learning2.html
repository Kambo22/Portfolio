                      <p>In the initial week, I had the delightful opportunity to join Fontys' Out of Space event. It was a fantastic experience where I connected with upper-semester individuals who generously offered guidance on navigating this semester successfully. Their insights greatly aided my understanding of the requirements for passing. Being part of such an event was truly invaluable, and I'm immensely thankful for the chance to participate. Below, you'll find my reflections on this event.</p>
                      <p>For me the work in the first week has really paid off. I got to meet people from higher semesters and get a feel for what is to come.But the highlight was the presentation from Andre Kuipers, i am grateful to have attended a lecture by a dutch legend such as him.Afterwards with my department we began work on the music video that we are going to present, although i felt like i wouldnt be of any use to the group since i don't have nearly as much experience i think i did a good enough job with the help of my teammates.</p>
                      <p>The whole document of the reflections and project plans you can see below</p>

                            <p>Following the initial submission, I felt content with the appearance of my website, believing it looked good. Although I acknowledged a slight deficiency in information, I anticipated receiving at least some guidance. Contrary to my expectations, the feedback indicated "undefined" for all my outcomes. Initially, this was disconcerting and demotivating, as I had put in my best effort, and not obtaining the expected results was frustrating. However, upon reflection, I decided to channel my energy into seeking constructive feedback rather than dwelling on the disappointment. I believe this approach will pave the way for a more promising start in achieving positive outcomes for my second portfolio submission.

                              My primary objective for the next three years is to successfully complete my university education, and falling behind after the first submission has motivated me to work harder than ever. I initiated the process by gathering feedback from all my teachers, meticulously noting their insights in a notebook, and then delved into the work. This time, my focus has been on more comprehensive documentation, and I believe that achieving a positive start is a very attainable goal this time around.

                      <p>For this project, the two classes in the second semester of media were split into two groups—one tasked with defending the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and the other with highlighting its negative aspects. To accomplish this, we had to gather relevant information, present our findings, and engage in a debate to articulate and support our respective positions on the subject.</p>
                      <p>Following our discussions, the teachers introduced us to the applications of AI to enhance efficiency in our work. We utilized AI to swiftly generate a prototype website for our client, Athina. The remarkable aspect was the speed at which an entire website could be created. However, I hold the view that tools like Azure or Figma offer a bit more control over the creative process. You can explore the website we crafted using the AI program Hocoos by clicking the button below.</p>

                      <p>In conclusion my stance on AI remains somewhat in the middle I know that it is fast and can save a lot of time but I prefer to be in control especially when creating projects that require creativity.</p>

                      <p>To start, I placed a significant emphasis on enhancing the navigability of my portfolio, especially considering the feedback about its difficulty in navigating with the three main sections: Technical Skills, Professional Skills, and Professional Identity. This time, I chose to divide the six outcomes, drawing inspiration from my classmate Thijs, who also assisted me in implementing this change. A visual representation of the new layout is posted on the left.</p>

                      <p>The second improvement I made was to the overall design of the pages for different outcomes. This time, I invested more time in creating the texts, starting with a Word document. Only after I was satisfied with the text did I transfer it to my portfolio. In terms of design, I incorporated more space for pictures. Initially, this posed a challenge as the images were displacing the text, but with assistance from Wit and Thijs, we successfully resolved the issue.</p>

                      <p>I have several goals for the next few years, with the primary one being to successfully complete the semester. Given that this has been my most stressful semester yet, I've engaged in reflection and taken significant steps towards improvement. One crucial realization is the importance of feedback to my progress. Consequently, I plan on actively seeking feedback for every change I make until the end of the semester. 
                      My second goal is centered around my future aspirations. Recognizing my interest in focusing on front-end programming, I've decided to explore additional options. To broaden my skill set, I've embarked on an online course to attain a certificate in C#. The rationale behind this decision is rooted in the belief that a professional with proficiency in both back-end and front-end skills would be more desirable than someone solely specializing in the front end.</p>

                        Throughout this semester, I've experienced a range of emotions, including stress, happiness, and pride, all of which have played a significant role in my personal growth. I've learned the importance of communication with teachers and stakeholders, realizing how it can help in setting personal goals. There were times when I felt stuck, but feedback sessions with my teachers provided insight to make everything click into place. This helped me push forward, creating better projects each time.
                        Moreover, my coding skills have seen substantial growth. I've improved my HTML and CSS skills to the point that looking at my old code now makes me think, "What even is this?" Also, I delved into JavaScript, learning how to use it to create projects like the digital library and the snake game. While I know there's much more to learn, I'm motivated to continue improving and enhancing my skills.
